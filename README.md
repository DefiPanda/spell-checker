spell-checker  
======  
Spell-checker is a spell-checker written in Clojure. It does spell-recommendation for any sentence with at most one word-spelling, within one Damerauâ€“Levenshtein distance, error. (The heuristic is most misspelled sentence is with only one word spelled wrong. Almost all spell-checker just consider one-word error case.) Spell-checker can correct both syntax and semanatically wrong sentences, and it can also corrects some grammar mistakes, such as the singular vs. plural error.

Usage  
---  
You can use your own dictionary, ngrams and edit-cost files to tailor your customized need. One example is in a highly-specialized field, such as computational biology, the traditional spell-checkers don't work well, but providing your customized data on this spell-checker will give a better spell-checking performance. If you don't want to provide your own spelling data, the default spelling-data is located at /data folder.  
  
The file at /test/test.clj provides a sample use of this spell checker.

Input:  
"Doing a spell-checker is a great way two learn NLP. Doing a spell-checker is a graet way to learn NLP.  
Doing a spell-checker is a great way to learnt NLP. Doing a spell-checker is a gkeat way to learn NLP?  
Doing a spell-checker is a grat way to learn NLP! Doing a spell-checker is a great way to learn NLP.  
It won't spilt the digit symbol into two sentences, like 1.2212. What about plural, such as one men? For some pluralizations this correct can makes it.  
It can works! It work! Isn't that veri cool?"   
  
Output:

Analysis:  
Let us do a sentence by sentence analysis on our spell-checker's output when given the above input. The format of following analysis is:  
input sentence ==> output sentence by this spell-checker  
  
ALL PASSED:  
(semantically wrong: "two" should be "to")  
Doing a spell-checker is a great way two learn NLP. ==> Doing a spell-checker is a great way to learn NLP.  
  
(transposition: "graet" should be "great")  
Doing a spell-checker is a graet way to learn NLP. ==> Doing a spell-checker is a great way to learn NLP.  
  
(addition: "learnt" should be "learn")  
Doing a spell-checker is a great way to learnt NLP. ==> Doing a spell-checker is a great way to learn NLP.  
  
(replacement: "gkeat" should be "great")  
Doing a spell-checker is a gkeat way to learn NLP? ==> Doing a spell-checker is a great way to learn NLP?   
  
(deletion: "grat" should be "great")  
Doing a spell-checker is a grat way to learn NLP! ==> Doing a spell-checker is a great way to learn NLP!    
  
(correct sentence: no change needed)  
Doing a spell-checker is a great way to learn NLP. ==> Doing a spell-checker is a great way to learn NLP.  
  
(transposition: "spilt" should be "split". Notice spell-checker will not recognize the digit sign in the number 1.2212 as a period, and that is the correct thing to do)  
It won't spilt the digit symbol into two sentences, like 1.2212. ==> It won't split the digit symbol into two sentences, like 1.2212.  
  
(plural vs. singular: "men" should be "man")  
What about plural, such as one men? ==> What about plural, such as one man?  
  
(verb following word "can" should be singular form: "makes" should be "make")  
For some pluralizations this correct can makes it. ==> For some pluralizations this correct can make it.  
  
(verb following word "can" should be singular form: "works" should be "work")  
It can works! => It can work!  
  
(third-person singular: "work" should be "works")  
It work! => It works!  
  
(replacement: "veri" should be "very")  
Isn't that veri cool? => Isn't that very cool?
